     * @param int $fee The fee to pay for the transaction in Stroops. Must be at least the base fee

     *                 are added automatically during simulation. Default 100.
     * @param int $timeoutInSeconds The timebounds which should be set for transactions generated by the
     *                              contract client. Must be positive. Transactions not included in a ledger
     *                              within this time will expire and cannot be submitted. Default 300.
     * @param bool $simulate Whether to automatically simulate the transaction when constructing the
     *                       AssembledTransaction. Set to false if you need to modify the transaction
     *                       builder before simulation. Default true.
     * @param bool $restore If true, will automatically attempt to restore archived ledger entries
     *                      that need renewal. Requires source account with private key. Default true.
