# SEP-0001 (Stellar Info File) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2025-10-16 16:08:13

**SEP Version:** 2.7.0
**SEP Status:** Active
**SEP URL:** https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md

## SEP Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet
can find information about your organization’s Stellar integration. By setting
the home_domain of your Stellar account to the domain that hosts your
`stellar.toml`, you can create a definitive link between this information and
that account. Any website can publish Stellar network information, and the
`stellar.toml` is designed to be readable by both humans and machines.

If you are an anchor or issuer, the `stellar.toml` file serves a very important
purpose: it allows you to publish information about your organization and
token(s) that help to legitimize your offerings. Clients and exchanges can use
this information to decide whether a token should be listed. Fully and
truthfully disclosing contact and business information is an essential step in
responsible token issuance.

If you are a validator, the `stellar.toml` file allows you to declare your
node(s) to other network participants, which improves discoverability, and
contributes to the health and decentralization of the network as a whole.
